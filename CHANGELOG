- 32bit on Linux is now supported
- Added ranges, hex and some other escapes for character classes
- Added permutations groups to the Tavor format
- Allow infinite loops in the Tavor format
- Allow "if" in Tavor format to have no "else" branch
- Added token attribute "Count" to variables
- Make "to" and "from" optional for special token "Int"
- Switched default exec-argument-types to STDIN

v0.3
- Added Reduction of repeats
- Forward usage of attributes
- Arguments to automate delta debugging by executing external binaries
